## <a id="more"></a>Who am I?

This man whose name only looks hard to say, is a creative web developer, consultant, blogger, hiker and father. He is a puppet master of code, bending the backend code to his will in elegant and ingenious fashion.
He is a die hard fan but don't hold this against him because, well, he is still a team player and , umm, poutine.

### <a id="background"></a> A bit of background

I was born in Iran and started programming since I was 15. It has always been a fun activity for me and so I've tried to do my best to keep the code quality high and follow the best practices while having fun. 

I migrated to Australia to improve my lifestyle and being close to opportunities I simply didn't have in the past. I maintain a blog and speak at conferences occasionally.

### Hobbies

Apart from drinking lots of coffee and coding, I write blog posts, speak at meetups and conferences, go hiking, play guitar, run occasionally and recently babysit ðŸ˜Š (a lot).

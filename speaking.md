## Speaking at your event

If you have an event, do not hesitate to reach out and we can sort that out. If you see that your event's date is very close to one of the above in future section, and the subject you're looking for is different to those, then chances are very low that I could be involved.

That said, you know how to [reach me](/contactme).

This repository contains my personal website and blog. The theme is based on [Beautifull Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll), but I have made some customisations.

Please do not fork this clone this repo as it contains some configurations and content specific to my website ðŸ˜‰. You can use the link above for forking, however, feel free to have a look at how I've customised some of the details on the theme.
